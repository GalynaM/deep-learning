## deep-learning

## Project description:
### Create an algorithm to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful

### Tools used:
* Pandas and the Scikit-Learn.
* Leaflet JavaScript library to build interactive Maps.

### Preprocess Data
* 
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color.
* Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* A legend that provide context for map data.

### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Plots a second data set on a map additional to earchquakes to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
* Data on tectonic plates was taken from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
* A number of base maps to choose from, two different data sets separated into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
